# Phantasy Star Online Rich Presence
A lightweight python script adding Rich Presence to the Gamecube version of Phantasy Star Online by getting information from dolphin's memory.

The app is currently missing a bunch of image assets for levels. if you want to help, take good pictures of levels (using dolphin's freecam) and send them to me on discord (@lucaspec72). The images have to be 1024x1024 in size.

Here is the list of currently aquired level images :
Episode 1 Bosses
Lobby 1
Pioneer 2 city (episode 1)
Pioneer 2 labo (episode 2)
Forest 1
Forest 2
Cave 1
Ruins 1
Ruins 2
